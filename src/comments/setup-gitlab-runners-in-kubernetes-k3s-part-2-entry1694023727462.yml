  This looks more like an issue with your kubernetes cluster or permissions?


  It&#39;s quite hard to tell based on just the runner logs not outputting anything, are you able to check that all your services are running properly in the cluster and there are no errors being thrown from the cluster?


  The other thing I can think about is kubernetes version support by GitLab which should be at 1.27 now.
