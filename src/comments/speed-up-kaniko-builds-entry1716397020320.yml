message: This is interesting. Is there a reason that you do the build process
  inside of your dockerfile rather than in the CI environment? I run a separate
  job first that runs the yarn build and some other dependency building
  concurrently, then when that is all done, I run the Kaniko job and my
  dockerfile basically just copies in those artifacts.
