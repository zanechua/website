message: Hi, I don't know much about the TPI interface but do know from its name
  it sounds like its serial. In the days of LPC - which not all boards support
  now the LPC interface could be used to show post codes, much like the post
  code monitor on your board. For some reason now some manufacturers are
  choosing to leave this feature out. Is there any way the SPI interface could
  handle this function and if it is doable could it also provide pass through
  for the existing add on TPM module?
