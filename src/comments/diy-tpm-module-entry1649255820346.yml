  Thanks for this article; it was very helpful! I'm a professional engineering
  scientist and I've been eying the SLB9665 for a few weeks now as it may kill
  two birds with one stone for me regarding a project I'm working on. But I have
  some other questions about the TPM module slot on the motherboard in general
  that I haven't been able to find the info on, such as how much current can the
  +3VSB pin source, and the +3V3 pins source? I've been working on an
  aftermarket module with expanded features that would require a standby supply
  while the PC is off, and I don't want to run something like a DC barrel jack
  into the PC case from the outside to get constant power, so I've been
  considering using the +3VSB power in the TPM slot to power my module instead.
  But I'm looking for some more info on it.


  Also, buying SLB9665 chips at the moment is damn near impossible. And samples
  are out of the question as I just get shuffled around trying to obtain a
  couple. Any chance you might know where to get a few SLB9665 in TSSOP?


  I'd really love to chat more with you regarding TPM modules. I don't get on
  social media very much, but I'm on GitHub as @domiluci, and I can be found on
  Facebook under my full name. I'm also available by email. Hopefully we can
  find a way to get in touch! :)


  Thank you very much for the article, and thanks in advance for any help you
  may be able to provide!
