  I didn't include this this tidbit in the post because I figured it wasn't
  relevant, but when the module wasn't initially working, I did end up bridging
  the 3VSB+ to the 3V assuming that I did actually need to hook up 3VSB+. It
  turns out that when I did that and had slotted the module correctly (the
  second time), the motherboard refused to power on (Pressing the power button
  and nothing happens). Only when I removed the bridge, I was able to get the
  board to boot.


  As for the SLB9665TT20 modules, I bought them off AliExpress. You should be
  able to find them quite easily. I paid about $2 per chip.
