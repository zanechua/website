  I haven't touched Kaniko in awhile but I believe it was due to some issues with the `COPY` command which Kaniko has some edge case issues processing and based on my memory, it doesn't end up using the cache with the `COPY` command so you end up with longer build times. 


  In your testing, do you see improvements with just doing the build outside and using the `COPY` command?
