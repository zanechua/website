  Hey Zane, I followed your guide and managed to get the kubernates runners up
  and online.


  However, in the CI, it failed with 


  ```

  Waiting for pod gitlab-runner/runner-xozxxtrtr-project-1-concurrent-0-l9o9rcc4 to be running, status is Pending

  Waiting for pod gitlab-runner/runner-xozxxtrtr-project-1-concurrent-0-l9o9rcc4 to be running, status is Pending
  	ContainersNotInitialized: &quot;containers with incomplete status: [init-permissions]&quot;
  	PodFailed: &quot;&quot;
  	PodFailed: &quot;&quot;
  ERROR: Job failed (system failure): prepare environment: waiting for pod running: pod status is failed. Check https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/shells/index.html#shell-profile-loading for more information

  ```


  any idea what might be wrong ?
