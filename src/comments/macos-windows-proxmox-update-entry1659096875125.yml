  Hi there, thanks for sharing. Was there any additional configuration necessary
  to get the MOTU audio interface working on the host from a Windows guest? 

  I saw in your original post you added a few lines to the blacklist.conf, but
  that doesn't seem to do the trick for me. 

  Currently I have the device passed through and am able to see it from the
  guest-OS, but no sound...


  Thanks, Mike
