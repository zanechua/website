  Yes, please remove the changes you made for the ccache implementation.


  I actually linked the xcode-archive-cache issue ticket that has instructions
  on how to get you setup for a bare react native project, did you try that yet?


  The cache for this implementation is only meant to be used to build and you
  discard all the changes it makes to your xcode projects afterwards. Do not
  commit the changes to those files into the git repo.


  At which point do you get that error message?
