  Hey Matt,


  Yes you're absolutely right. That's the way that you can do it. You can take
  the commands and put them in the AppCenter scripts to use buildcache on their
  build machines too. I am no longer using buildcache as xcode-archive-cache
  works a bit faster. Though I could probably check my git history for the
  version that I implemented in the AppCenter scripts when I was using
  buildcache.


  I think I should write up a post about an end to end implementation on putting
  together all the parts to improve build times in AppCenter.
