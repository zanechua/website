message: Thanks for the info. I am trying to get this to run using a Docker
  image from a private docker repo and am failing at the login stage when the
  image is to be pulled from the repo. There isnt much information as to how to
  handle this in Gitlab CI Services. Do you have any idea how to get this to
  work? If I understand it correctly, this should work via setting the
  DOCKER_AUTH_CONFIG in the services' variable section but at least for me no
  luck thus far.
