  Cheers for this - very interesting. I'm a little confused though - the
  instructions are all about setting up buildcache on a mac, so I could install
  it locally and have faster builds locally. But how does this help on
  AppCenter, is there a way to get buildcache on there too so that AppCenter
  build agents can use it?


  Does it involve something like taking the bash script you posted, and running
  that as part of the build (I see you can add custom build scripts in AppCenter
  for example)
