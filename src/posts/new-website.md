Figured it's time I built a new site considering I never really finished the last one due to life and what not.

This site is now built with Gatsby, hosted on GitHub and distributed via CloudFlare.

Intending to write up a few posts about the rubbish I explore into.

Also intend to document my HomeLab here.
