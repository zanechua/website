E.g., Piling of the ground, reinforced concrete for the sewerage line, this is your chance to ask questions as well.

This I believe is referred to as \"Design and Build\" in the industry. If you look up the details about this process, you will realize that DnB projects tend to be more expensive and are used mainly when you need the construction to start earlier rather than later. You won't finish the architect's drawings before the construction starts. The construction will start and the architect will work with you whilst the house is building.

Otherwise, how are you actually evaluating each architect?

You are looking for an architect that will fit your needs. An architect who is open and transparent with you. If an architect has not done something before, they likely won't have the confidence to do it, but that doesn't mean that they should tell you it's not possible. You want them to \"check\" if it's possible since they are the professionals and not lie by omission.</p>\n<p>A good bad example of this was with the first architect. I am trying to build a multi-generational family home within a specific budget and based on that initial budget, they should know whether it's possible or not. E.g., $350–450 per square feet (psf) as a rough gauge to determine the built-up size. They started showing me very nice luxury houses from their portfolio, Good Class Bungalows, kitchens that were designed for private chefs which totally did not align with me at all. I asked if it was possible to have a water collection system and was told a straight up no, which is not exactly true. It is possible, but it just makes the submission a lot more complex if the water system is directly integrated into the home.</p>\n<p>I had the most meetings with the first architect as they were referred to me by a trusted friend, and they seem to have a decent name in the industry. They were very focused on \"closing\" the deal more so than working with me to understand my requirements and trying to fit within my budget (TBH my budget is not unreasonable). He offered to do some mockups to help me visualize what the layout would be and gave me very poor mockups which my Architect friend said was <code class=\"language-text\">a days worth of intern work</code>. I think that's frankly unacceptable considering they were asking for a minimum of $120,000 or 6% if the project is above $2,000,000. They got basic things like the placement of the gate wrong, the second revision took more than a week and didn't incorporate what I asked for. Therefore, I decided that they weren't the right fit for me and stopped talking to them since they weren't listening to me.</p>\n<p>In my opinion, architects are going to be paid $80,000 to $120,000, sometimes 6–10% of the project amount or even more. They have to put in the effort to engage you as the owner otherwise what service are they rendering to you? Would you pay someone $120,000 and the first example of the work they give you is a poorly drawn mockup?</p>\n<p>In the tech industry, the sales folks put a lot of effort into closing their clients. You would probably need to conduct a Proof of Concept or Proof of Value before you even talk about how much it will cost, etc.</p>\n<p>The architects are the professionals here, and they need to understand that we do not build houses for a living, and that's exactly why we are engaging them with their expertise. This means helping us visualize what the house will look like, explaining the process, reminding us about decisions that need to be made earlier rather than later, etc.</p>\n<p>Based on my requirements, I went with the traditional option as costs and quality were my guiding principles.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I am more than happy to be corrected on any misconceptions I have within this post, this is my POV as someone not in the construction industry, so I may not have the correct idea, perspective or expectations.</p>\n</blockquote>","headings":[{"id":"Journey","value":"Journey","depth":1},{"id":"Getting-Started","value":"Getting Started","depth":1},{"id":"Meeting-the-ArchitectsBuilders","value":"Meeting the Architects/Builders","depth":1},{"id":"Decisions","value":"Decisions","depth":1},{"id":"Evaluating-the-architectsbuilders","value":"Evaluating the architects/builders","depth":1},{"id":"Summary","value":"Summary","depth":1}],"excerpt":"Time to kickstart the build journey by meeting the professionals and picking either the architect or builder to build your home.
